WERMA is about software and data produced during the WERMA project.

WERMA stands for West-Europe Rail Map Archive.

Data consist mainly in lists of railway stations, ordered along rail routes, which have existed -or still exist- since creation of European railways.
The term "station" is used to encompassing any place a train can stop, from central station, hauptbanhof, gare vicinale, ... to simple on-demand stops, which may have existed with rural lines, tramways ...
All stations -during their lifetime- have been assiged to at least one "route", designated by a name, or a letter or number from some local or national network.
Route names may have changed through time, and in general, the most recent or the most common name has been chosen.
Station names may have changed as well, or may have different version (eg. in Belgium), and sometimes alt names are kept as an additional info.

Data structure.

We have been "inspired" by the INSPIRE(EU) ontology and formats for transportation data, but we have designed a simpler way to encoding minimal requested information.
This information allows to extract stations by "route" (station A to station B) and to ensure that routes connect to each other in a graph.
